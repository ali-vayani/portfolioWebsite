              <Section n={1} title="Intro">
                <P>Here&apos;s my guide to landing SWE internships.</P>
                <P>
                  Just to build some ethos on why I think I&apos;m credible on giving advice for
                  this: this past cycle I was in the trenches. I applied to like 200+ companies,
                  got 5+ interviews, and ended with 4 offers including one at <A href="https://stripe.com/" color="#6772e5">Stripe</A>, the company
                  that processes ~2% of the world&apos;s GDP and the one I&apos;ll be working at
                  this summer.
                </P>
                <P>I was also lucky enough to land a freshman year internship at <A href="https://americas.aramco.com/en" color="#3eb458">Aramco</A>.</P>
                <P>
                  I don&apos;t think what I accomplished was due to me being &ldquo;smarter&rdquo;
                  or anything. It was just &ldquo;optimizing&rdquo; for the game that recruiting
                  is. The reason I&apos;m writing this is because I think I&apos;ve learned a lot,
                  and I don&apos;t see the point in gatekeeping this info, especially since I
                  wouldn&apos;t be where I am without the help of so many people.
                </P>
              </Section>

              <Section n={2} title="What's the Goal?">
                <P>First, before you do anything, what is your goal?</P>
                <P>
                  The reason this question is important is because it&apos;ll allow you to realize:
                </P>
                <OL>
                  <li>How much work you need to put in</li>
                  <li>How far you are</li>
                </OL>
                <P>
                  For example, my goal was to always land the best internship possible. This meant
                  that even when I had 3 offers in my hand, I still applied and still interviewed
                  when I thought the company or opportunity was better.
                </P>
                <P>
                  If you&apos;re not as crazy/obsessed as I am, then maybe you can get content
                  faster and not stress as much as I did.
                </P>
              </Section>

              <Section n={3} title="Reality">
                <P>Now that you have a goal in mind, let me be real.</P>
                <P>
                  Getting a SWE internship in this market is not easy, but it&apos;s not as hard as
                  people make it out to be. If you&apos;re spending your time doing something — ie:
                  focusing on school, being active in orgs, or just tinkering on the side — you
                  will 100% be fine.
                </P>
                <P>
                  I have a lot of friends that didn&apos;t grind the way I did and now they&apos;re
                  interning at Amazon, Patreon, IBM, and other strong companies.
                </P>
                <P>
                  I think going to a T10 CS program helps a lot, so even if you&apos;re entering
                  your junior year and you don&apos;t have any formal experience, you&apos;ll be
                  fine as long as you put in the work.
                </P>
                <P>
                  if you don&apos;t go to a target CS program then know your journey will be harder,
                  but it&apos;s still very doable. you might have to fight for more oppurtunities to
                  land a big name brand, but it&apos;s still possible, you just have to optimize for
                  different things in addition to what i have to say here.
                </P>

              <Section n={4} title="Resume">
                <P>
                  Your resume is single-handedly the most important thing when applying to
                  internships.
                </P>
                <P>
                  It doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re a <A href="https://leetcode.com/" color="#FFA116">LeetCode</A> demon if you can&apos;t land a
                  single interview.
                </P>
                <P>When it comes to building a resume, there are two things that matter:</P>
                <OL>
                  <li>The content</li>
                  <li>The framing</li>

                <Sub title="Content">
                  <P>
                    You ofc need projects and experiences to put on the resume. This can be open
                    source contributions, projects you&apos;ve made, or previous internships/work
                    experience you have.

                  <P>
                    I think the single highest EV thing you can have on your resume is working on
                    something with <strong className="text-white font-semibold">real users</strong>.

                  <P>
                    This doesn&apos;t mean you need to build something from the ground up. This
                    means you can contribute to open source projects or join orgs.

                    UT Registration Plus is a hack istg. Just push one PR to that jawn and you can
                    say you pushed code to a platform with 60k+ users.
                  </Callout>
                  <P>
                    With AI, it&apos;s become so much easier to larp your experiences that one of
                    the only ways to stand out is by shipping to real users.

                  <Callout>Every bullet point should be defendable in an interview.</Callout>
                  <P>
                    If you&apos;re asked about a number, be able to explain how you came to that

                    Don&apos;t say one of your coworkers/teammates measured it — a friend did this
                    once and the interviewer just stared at him.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    Also, make sure to use the <A href="https://simplify.jobs/blog/how-to-use-the-xyz-resume-format" color="#0ea5e9">XYZ format</A>. Google literally tells you to. Search it
                    up if you&apos;re not familiar with it.

                <Sub title="Quick Note on Grad Date">
                  <P>
                    If you&apos;re an underclassman, I&apos;d rec pushing your grad date up a year
                    on your resume. This will give you a competitive edge.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    Even if you don&apos;t currently plan on graduating early, you definitely can
                    and plans change. I initially never thought I would, but now I&apos;m very
                    heavily considering it if I get the return offer.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    Also, if you think you can&apos;t, you probably can, but you may have to take a
                    summer semester — your last semester — or switch from the BS → BSA.

              <Section n={5} title="Interview Prep">
                <P>Some general advice is do 1-2 <A href="https://leetcode.com/" color="#FFA116">LeetCode</A> questions a day.</P>
                <P>
                  I will say this is sound advice and def do that. LeetCode sadly isn&apos;t
                  something you can cram like that, so start early and be consistent.
                </P>
                <P>
                  I&apos;d highly recommend going through the <A href="https://neetcode.io/" color="#22c55e">NeetCode roadmap</A> or solving the <A href="https://neetcode.io/" color="#22c55e">Blind 75</A> at the minimum. These are questions that have patterns that consistently repeat.
                </P>
                <P>
                  At the end of the day, LeetCode is just pattern recognition with a twist, so the
                  more questions the better.
                </P>

                <Sub title="LeetCode Is Not the Only Format">
                  <P>Now onto some truth.</P>
                  <P>
                    LeetCode interviews are not the only type of interviews. Out of all the
                    interviews I&apos;ve done, only 2 of them were LeetCode-style.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    This doesn&apos;t mean LeetCode is obsolete and you don&apos;t need to do it.
                    This just means it&apos;s not the only other format.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    Some companies ask pure conceptual questions and others mimic real programming.
                    These questions are harder to prep for, so your best bet is crowdsourcing info.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    Most larger tech companies do LeetCode because it&apos;s easy for them, so
                    practice.
                  </P>
                  <Callout>Bloomberg has like 5 rounds of LeetCode iirc.</Callout>
                  <P>
                    With that being said, if you want to be OD and a degenerate like me, then
                    I&apos;d recommend joining the{" "}
                    <A href="https://www.cscareers.dev/" color="#6366f1">cscareerdev</A> Discord server and looking for people who&apos;re
                    interviewing at the same company as you and asking for their experiences.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    You&apos;d be surprised at how much you can learn and how much of an edge this
                    can provide.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    I&apos;ve also heard interview formats are subject to change this year with the
                    addition of AI tools. I know I&apos;ve heard Meta is switching things up, and I
                    know Amazon asked some people some weird AI prompting questions.

                <Sub title="Communicating">
                  <P>One thing that will always be consistent though is communicating.</P>
                  <P>
                    No matter the technical interview, always explain your thought process. There
                    should never be more than 5 seconds of silence. You should always be saying
                    what&apos;s going through your mind.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    This is partially why I landed <A href="https://stripe.com/" color="#6772e5">Stripe</A> despite not full solving a technical round.

                    This is the only thing you need to know for behavioral, plus
                    stories/experiences. Use ChatGPT or a friend to prep beforehand.

                    ChatGPT is also really good at cooking up practice questions. I&apos;d just walk

                  it dropping, if not faster. I remember literally applying to jobs in a movie
                  theater.
                </P>
                <P>
                  The way I went about it was just spam checking zero2sudo&apos;s IG stories and
                  applying ASAP.
                </P>
                <P>
                  Another method: search for SWE internships on LinkedIn, filter by &ldquo;past
                  24hrs,&rdquo; and change <Code>84000</Code> in the URL to <Code>3600</Code>. This
                  filters to the past 1 hour instead of 24.

              <Section n={7} title="Bonus: Referrals & Networking">
                <P>Some very generic advice people give out is to network or get referrals.</P>
                <P>Out of all the interviews I got, only one of them came from a referral.</P>
                <P>
                  Referrals are really common nowadays because of how large the pools are, but I
                  think they&apos;re useful in some specific edge cases.
                </P>
                <P>
                  I got my freshman year internship at <A href="https://americas.aramco.com/en" color="#3eb458">Aramco</A> through a referral. The pool of people
                  that could refer was small. Because of this, I think my referral mattered so much
                  more because not many people had the opportunity of getting one.
                </P>
                <P>This was due to it being Aramco Americas, a small American branch for a Saudi company.</P>
                <P>
                  I&apos;ve also heard companies like <A href="https://stripe.com/" color="#6772e5">Stripe</A> &amp; Databricks fast track your
                  application if you get referred. There just aren&apos;t many people to give
                  referrals, so they get valued more.
                </P>
                <P>
                  A way to determine if a referral is helpful is just by looking at company size.
                  Stripe and Databricks have ~10k employees compared to Google&apos;s 200k or
                  Amazon&apos;s 350k.
                </P>
                <P>If the connection is harder to make, then it&apos;s worth more.</P>
